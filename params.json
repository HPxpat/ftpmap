Fingerprint engine bug fixed.\r\n2. ftpmap->fid removed (using gfid)\r\n3. Code cleanup.\r\n4. new tool proftpd_versions.py\r\n5. FTP error code bug fixed.\r\n6. -o removed, using global log file ftpmap_scan.log.\r\n\r\n#### For release 1.0 we need TODO:\r\n\r\n* Testing if FTPMap is stable .\r\n* Adding more fingerprints.\r\n* security check. (overflows, etc..)\r\n\r\n#### FTPMap should work on ( As far I know): \r\n\r\n* linux (Arch, Debian, Fedora etc..) 100%\r\n* ARM (RaspberryPi, Android etc..). 100%\r\n* BSD (FreeBSD, etc..) 100%\r\n* Mac? (I didn't test)\r\n* Windows (Cygwin?)\r\n\r\n###### For any question/help, you can reach me in: [@Hypsurus](https://twitter.com/Hypsurus)\r\n\r\n#### FTP-Map is open source and free, Please help me with:\r\n\r\n* Send bug reports.\r\n* Code! we need more featuers.\r\n* More fingerprints!\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n=====\r\n\r\nFtpmap scans remote FTP servers to indentify what software and what versions\r\nthey are running. It uses program-specific fingerprints to discover the name\r\nof the software even when banners have been changed or removed, or when some\r\nfeatures have been disabled. FTP-Map will try to detect exploits by the  \r\nFTP software/version.\r\n\r\nPlease send the fingerprint and the name of the software to hypsurus@mail.ru.\r\nAnother indication that can be displayed if login was successful is the FTP\r\nPORT sequence prediction. If the difficulty is too low, it means that anyone\r\ncan steal your files and change their content, even without knowing your\r\npassword or sniffing your network.\r\nThere are very few known fingerprints yet, but submissions are welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n![FtpMap014](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hypsurus/ftpmap/master/ftpmap014.png)\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n=====\r\n\r\n    ./configure\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install \r\n\r\nUsage\r\n======\r\n\r\n\r\n* Scan server:\r\n    > ftpmap -Sgs localhost\r\n\r\n* Scan multiple FTP servers:\r\n    > ftpmap -gL list.txt\r\n\r\n* Upload a file.\r\n    > ftpmap -s localhost --user root --password root -U 'topsecretfile.txt'\r\n\r\n* Download a file:\r\n    > ftpmap -s localhost --user root --password root -d '/topsecretfile.txt'\r\n\r\n* list files:\r\n    > ftpmap -s localhost --user anonymous -p null -l '/'\r\n\r\n* use --help for the full options.\r\n\r\n\r\nObfuscating FTP servers\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n\r\nThis software was written as a proof of concept that security through\r\nobscurity doesn't work. Many system administrators think that hidding or\r\nchanging banners and messages in their server software can improve security.\r\n\r\nDon't trust this. Script kiddies are just ignoring banners. If they read\r\nthat \"XYZ FTP software has a vulnerability\", they will try the exploit on\r\nall FTP servers they will find, whatever software they are running. The same\r\nthing goes for free and commercial vulnerability scanners. They are probing\r\nexploits to find potential holes, and they just discard banners and messages.\r\nOn the other hand, removing software name and version is confusing for the\r\nsystem administrator, who has no way to quickly check what's installed on his\r\nservers.\r\n\r\nIf you want to sleep quietly, the best thing to do is to keep your systems\r\nup to date : subscribe to mailing lists and apply vendor patches.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\n==========\r\n\r\nUsage of FTPMap for attacking targets without prior mutual consent is illegal.\r\nFTPMap developer (@Hypsurus) not responsible to any damage caused by FTPMap.\r\n\r\nGet FTP-Map\r\n=============\r\n                git clone git://github.com/Hypsurus/ftpmap \r\n\r\nThe END\r\n=========\r\n    \r\n    Copyright 2015 (C) FTP-Map project developers.\r\n    License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
